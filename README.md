Simple weather app in Vue

This was based on the weather app tutorial provided by Tyler Potts on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLc-hWsPTUY

Some minor adjustments made by me to better suit my region:
1) Changed units to Fahrenheit
2) Changed the order of the date to match American standard

Also changed some of the styling to what I perceive to be a bit cleaner.
